The Task
========
Short version: Take a picture of a birdie
Long version: Leave a camera pointing at a bird table through the lens of a DSLR camera. Use image recognition to identify when a bird lands on the table, then take a picture by triggering the DSLR.


The Technology
==============
Raspberry Pi (well, obviously)
Standard Pi camera
Python
Microsoft ELL


The Approach
============
Install ELL on a PC to create a model that can be downloaded to the Pi.
Download a pre-trained model that can identify birds.
3D-print a mount for the Pi camera to the DSLR viewfinder.
Build a circuit to trigger the DSLR shutter.
Create Python program that uses the model and triggers the DSLR.


Hopefully also
==============
Create variant of the Python program to identify when a person appears in shot and take a picture with the Pi camera, to be used outside Mark's door.
Create variant of the Python program to identify when a cat appears in shot and take a picture with the Pi camera, to be used inside James' cat flap.
